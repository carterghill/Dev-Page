          My name is Carter Hill and I am a software developer based in Saskatchewan, Canada.
          My main passion lies in game development, but I have always found enjoyment in
          all aspects of computer science, and finding ways to automate or improve things.
          Having experience both in coding complex game mechanics as well as automating
          hundreds of hours of tedious labour down to a single click, I am prepared for any
          type of challenge.

          If you've ever fantasized about having a website for your business, or wished you had
          software better suited for your daily tasks, contacting me could be your place
          to start. I am open to exploring ideas and finding a solution to your problem.
          If you're just here to look around, checkout my ongoing projects to see what I've been up to.
